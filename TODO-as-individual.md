# X-Team Exercise #2a TODO INDIVIDUALLY

This document describes what X-team members must do individually to complete X-Team Exercise #2. 
This is an X-Team exercise, but this x-team exercise must be completed by each individual member of the team.  
It is my hope that your X-team will all meet together with your computers and internet connection 
and help each member complete the entire exercise in less than one hour.
