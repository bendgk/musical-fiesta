# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Tasks will be assigned to those who have an interest/expertise for the task. If there is
a task that has not been assigned, then we can assign the task to someone who is
available to work on the task. Tasks should be switched up to make sure everyone
is familiar every part of the project.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
If team members have to do individual work, they can commit and push their work
so other team members can stay updated.

We can communicate via messaging and meeting in person to keep aligned with 
team objectives.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Difficulties should be communicated via messaging to see if some high-level
solution can be offered by teammates. If that doesn't work, teammates can 
meet in-person to offer further support.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Keep track of final deadlines and keep our own deadlines, so if we need to
fix anything we can do it before the final deadline.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Everyone should have a positive attiude.
